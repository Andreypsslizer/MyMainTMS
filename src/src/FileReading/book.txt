However, if you're calling this function a lot, and you expect many of the checks to fail due to not being a number
then performance of this mechanism will not be great, since you're relying upon exceptions being thrown for each
failure, which is a fairly expensive operation.

An alternative approach may be to use a regular expression to check for validity of being a number:

Be careful with the above RegEx mechanism, though, as it will fail if you're using non-Arabic digits (i.e. numerals
other than 0 through to 9). This is because the "\d" part of the RegEx will only match [0-9] and effectively isn't
internationally numerically aware. (Thanks to OregonGhost for pointing this out!)
Or even another alternative is to use Java's built-in object to see if, after parsing the
string the parser position is at the end of the string. If it is, we can assume the entire string is numeric:
